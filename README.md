# Dhilly Game 6 Remake
Dhilly Game 6 is a homebrew Game Boy Color game made with GB Studio 3.1. The source code is missing, yet many changes are asked of the devs. I, Eve (Also known as "LenEnjoyer" and "MS3"), am going to remake this game, potentially with help from my friends. The remake will include:
- More polish
- Bonus content
- Better graphics
- Bug fixes
- Multiplayer via link cable (Will work wirelessly on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console release, if emulating, check your favourite emulator for link cable emulation support)
- Compatibility with Game Boy hardware (Previous only worked with Game Boy Color hardware)
- Super Game Boy (SNES) enhancements (Border and preset palettes)
- **Difficulty balancing**

Please edit the .gbsproj file with GB Studio 4.0. Check your GB Studio version before editing.

# Credit
So far, the project has been exclusively made by me, Eve, mainly due to the motivation of hack club's Arcade. However. others are free to help, and this remake does retain the story and a few of the levels of the original game, which were made by StanDX.

# Testing
While I still intend to add more to the game, it is playable from start to finish, and you may enjoy it at the [online demo](https://bottom.monster/rand/dhilly6)

# Build instructions
You can build the game using [GB Studio 4.0](https://chrismaltby.itch.io/gb-studio).
